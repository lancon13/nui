1. Refactor the code to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.
2. Add support for markers on the slider – markers should be passed as a function (see https://quasar.dev/vue-components/range#markers).
3. Display markers on the opposite side of the slider.
4. Allow the slider to have an inner minimum and maximum value.
5. Remove the dragging delay on the tooltip.
6. Ensure thumb dragging is smooth and responsive, allowing continuous movement and snapping to the exact position when the mouse is released.
7. Provide a clear visual indication when the thumb is being dragged or focused.
8. Add support for a vertical orientation, if needed.
9. Implement a read‑only mode for the slider.
